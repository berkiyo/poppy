# Poppy GTK Theme
A GTK3+ theme inspired by Pop and Arc! It uses the Arc styles but with the Pop colour scheme. Like many who like to try out new themes, I like to change it up and this colour pallete has grown on me. I prefer the slimmer look of the Arc GTK theme and it also themes very nicely with almost all applications. 

A special thanks to the creators and contributors of Oomox for making this possible!
